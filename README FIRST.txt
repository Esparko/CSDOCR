CSD OCR README
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSD OCR (Cook Serve Delicious Optical Character Recognition) is a program that 
uses Capture2Text. It enables users to automate recipes in the CSD game.
I created and released this because CSD's leaderboards have stopped updating
with the release of CSD 2. I will not be making this for CSD 2.

Visit the script's Github page:
https://github.com/Esparko/CSDOCR

Capture2Text is provided. You can also choose to download Capture2Text here:           http://capture2text.sourceforge.net/

This is my first coding project. Thanks for using it!

IMPORTANT (Limitations of CSD OCR)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!!!
- Check Capture2Text settings and look for "Start OCR Capture" under the Hotkeys 
  tab. Change it to "Shift + Backspace".
- The program runs on specific delays and is effected by lag. If combos are not     executing properly increase the hotkey delay. 50 (the default value) is the 
  lowest it could go on my computer before recipes stopped working.
- Despite a lot of testing Capture2Text reads "4" as "1" when trying to make
  coffee. This only affects coffee so it will make a mistake when making coffee 
  with 4 sugars.
!!!
- CSD OCR needs to run as admin or else it won't work. The script will 
  automatically try to run with admin privelages. Press YES during the UAC prompt.
- Capture2Text also needs to run with admin privelages. The script should
  automatically run Capture2Text as an admin.
- If the script is not working check if Capture2Text and the script are running 
  as admin.
- Ensure that Cook, Serve, Delicious is running before starting the script.
- Do not play the game in fullscreen or else the script will not work.
- Do not resize the window after the script resizes it or else the calibration.
  will not be correct. If you accidentally resized the window. Press the
  "Save Settings and Run Script" button again to rerun the checks.

INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Check whether or not you have upgraded equipment. Chores' key macros
  are different when you buy upgrades.
- Press F1 (default key) when you are doing chores or cooking food. This starts 
  the OCR process. Avoid moving the mouse during OCR process. You will see your 
  mouse click and drag to select the text.
- Open the program and browse for "Capture2Text.exe" as the executable file



Have fun!
